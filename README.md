# Floating Thoughts
Simple UI for visualising thoughts

Add your thoughts and watch them float around the screen. Pop them when you like. 
I am using this as a Todo list.
I need to improve my design skills.

- popping noise âœ…
- draggable bubbles
    - This is difficult at the moment because of how the floating works. Updating position in realtime wont work unless we change the css. Needs some thought ðŸ¤”
- save in local storage âœ…
